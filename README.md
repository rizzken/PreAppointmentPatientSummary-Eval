# PreSurgicalNotes-Eval

Quality evaluation of pre-surgical medical notes summarization

## Project Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the quality of synthetic medical discharge notes and the performance of generative AI models in summarizing them for pre-operative preparation.

**Goal**  
Identify common data quality issues (missing values, duplicates, invalid entries) and weaknesses in AI-generated summaries (hallucinations, omission of critical information, factual inconsistency) to assess the safety and reliability of using AI for creating concise patient overviews for surgeons.

The project is inspired by a real-world need in surgical practice: surgeons require a quick, accurate summary of a patient’s medications, allergies, recent procedures, and risks before an operation.

## Skills & Tools Demonstrated

- Manual & exploratory testing
- Data quality validation (missing values, duplicates, range checks, consistency)
- Python + pandas + sqlite3 for data analysis
- Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., Falconsai/medical_summarization)
- Text generation quality metrics (ROUGE, manual faithfulness evaluation)
- GitHub + Google Colab for development and version control
